# Data-mining-project
The purpose of this project is to predict the probability that there are or not deaths in terrorist attacks based on some characteristics, such as the area of the attack or the type of weapon used.

Fitted models are logistic regression, naive bayes, classification tree, k nearest neighbors, neural network and random forest.

Data are available in the "globalterrorism1.csv" file, which is compressed in "globalterrorism1.zip".
Report with results is available as "ATTACCHI TERRORISTICI.pdf"
